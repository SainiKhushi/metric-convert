# [Metric-Imperial Converter](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/metric-imperial-converter)
<br> Need Helps and suggestions to get the following test passed:<br>
<li>
  <ol>1.All incoming units should be accepted in both upper and lower case, but should be returned in both the initUnit and returnUnit in lower case, except for liter, which should be represented as an uppercase 'L'.</ol>
  <ol>2.If my number is invalid, returned will be 'invalid number'.</ol>
  <ol>3.If both the unit and number are invalid, returned will be 'invalid number and unit'</ol>
  <ol>4.My return will consist of the initNum, initUnit, returnNum, returnUnit, and string spelling out units in the format '{initNum} {initial_Units} converts to {returnNum} {return_Units}' with the result rounded to 5 decimals.</ol>
  <ol>5. 16 unit tests and 5 functional test </ol>  
</li>
